## DCGANs-Based SOFC Synthetic Data Generation Method

## abstract

Solid Oxide Fuel Cell(SOFC) is attracting attention as a next-generation fuel cell for its eco-friendliness and efficiency.
However, surface defects may occur during manufacturing, leading to poor quality and material failure. Deep learning has
recently become widespread in research and has been implemented in various applications, including surface defect inspection
using computer vision. However, images show defects are limited, making the dataset class imbalanced, and it becomes
problematic. Therefore, we propose a method for generating synthetic data based on Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial
Networks to solve the limited data problem, train with deep learning, and evaluate it.
